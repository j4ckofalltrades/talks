# Git Deep Dive

A talk about `git` for SheCodes Plus Masterclass Day 2024.

This talk covers a short history of `git`, a peek into the `.git` directory
(and its internals), exploring workflows (focusing on the Feature Branch
Workflow), dealing with merge conflicts, comparing merge vs rebase, git commands
that you might not have heard of before (that you can add to your toolkit), and
a bunch of tips and tricks.

The slides are available in the following formats:

- [HTML](https://jduabe.dev/git-deep-dive)
- [Markdown](git-deep-dive.md)
- [PDF](git-deep-dive.pdf)
